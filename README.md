## About The Project

[![CodeSquad Comics logo]](https://github.com/CodeSquad-Boston/course-project-rsensenig/blob/main/public/images/CodeSquad-Comics-logo.png?raw=true)

CodeSquad Comics is a collection of graphic novels read by Rachel Sensenig. The site is intended to display comic book covers along with information about each book, including the author, a rating, and other details about the graphic novel. You can browse through the complete collection on the homepage. Click on the cover image or the Details link to see even more information for each graphic novel including the publisher, genre, number of pages, and a brief synopsis. The About page includes meta information about this collection. Login is only available to the site administrator at this time.

<!-- Project Status -->
## Project Status
This project is still under development. Here is a log of current bugs that I'm working on:

1/23/2023 - I switched deploying my site from Heroku to Cyclic since Heroku removed most of its free services. With the site deployed on Cyclic though, I'm logged out when I try to edit or delete comics on my Admin dashboard. I believe this is related to the fact that Cyclic is serverless. My Admin dashboard still fully works locally.
